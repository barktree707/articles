A 3D model is a mathematical representation of any three-dimensional object (real or imagined) in a 3D software environment. Unlike a 2D image, 3D models can be viewed from any angle, where they can be scaled, rotated, or modified freely.
A 3D model can be divided into two categories: solid models and surface models. Solid models define the volume of the object they represent (like a rock), while surface models define the shape of the object they represent (like a sphere). Surface models are further divided into subtypes based on specific features, such as NURBS surfaces (smooth curves), polygonal meshes (triangles or quads), subdivision surfaces (polygons with varying levels of detail), etc.
A 3D model consists of various components that define its geometry, appearance, behavior, and interaction with other objects or systems. Some of these components are:
Vertices: The points where edges meet on a polygonal mesh.
Edges: The lines that connect vertices on a polygonal mesh.
Faces: The polygons that form the surface of a solid model or an NURBS surface.
Normals: The vectors that point outward from each face on a polygonal mesh.
UV coordinates: The values that map each vertex on a polygonal mesh to an image on its surface.
Texture coordinates: The values that map each vertex on an NURBS surface to an image on its surface.
Materials: The properties that define how light interacts with different parts of a 3D model (such as color, reflectivity, transparency, etc.)
Shaders: The programs that run on the GPU and determine how each pixel on the screen is rendered based on its position in relation to the camera and other objects.
Bones: The joints that allow flexible movement of parts of a characterâ€™s body in animation systems.
Animations: The sequences of poses or actions that define how an object moves over time.
